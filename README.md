# ofQProjectGenerator
Makes it easy to generate qmake project files for openFrameworks 0.8.4 and v0.9.
CMake projects only have support for v0.9, and QMake projects only have support for v0.8.4. :D
I plan to fix that soon. But you are so very welcome to send a PR. ;)

You can read about how CMake projects work [here](http://zmc.space/2016/using-openFrameworks-v0.9-with-cmake/).
